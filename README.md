# Artificial Intelligence Benchmark

## General Idea

The main idea of this project is to asses the current capabilities of various popular Artificial Intelligence models in the sphere of software development. In order to do so, several benchmarks will be performed on each AI model 

## 
## Technical Aspects
### Possible difficulties
- In order to get a more realistic overview, the usage of free models can be considered not sufficient enough. Thus the price may come up as an issue.
    - Possible solution: Use the free tier models for the general benchmark creation.

### Technology Used

#### The Paper

The Paper is planned to be written in LaTeX, due to its convenience and the freedom of customisation. Other alternatives (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc.) can be chosen if the teacher requires to do so.

#### Benchmarks 

The programming language chosen for this project is python. The main reason for this is the fact that based on the table most models have APIs for either Python or Javascript.   

## Benchmark Subjects 

Below is a table with the latest information on the most popular AI models for which are have APIs.

## Deadlines and Time Management

The planned deadline for finishing the paper is **the end of the autumn break**. This way I will have enough time to work on it during the summer break and afterwards during the autumn break. Despite the fact that I do have a language exchange program, the programm itself takes only 3-4 hours in the morning with the rest of the day free for my usage.

Below is showed a rough plan of the working process and the possible meetings (has to be ajusted with the supervisor):

|**Time**| **Task**  |**Expected Progress**   | **Status**  |
|---|---|---|---|
| 04.06.2024  | Discussion of possible issues that can come up based on the current plan | Plan created, research of the various models is done  | *to be assigned*  |
|   |   |   | *to be agreed*  |
|   |   |   |   |
