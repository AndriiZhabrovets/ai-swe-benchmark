\subsection{Expanding the Benchmark}
Expanding the scope of the benchmark is a crucial step for enhancing its relevance and comprehensiveness. While the current benchmark primarily focuses on solving algorithmic problems, programming in real-world settings encompasses a much broader range of tasks. Introducing debugging problems, for example, could assess an AI’s ability to identify and fix errors in existing code, a skill that is fundamental to professional software development yet remains underexplored in most AI evaluations.

Another area of expansion could involve problems requiring the use of external libraries and APIs. These tasks would evaluate how effectively AI models can understand and incorporate pre-existing tools and frameworks into their solutions. Additionally, optimization problems, where the goal is not merely to find a correct solution but the most efficient one, would push AI models to demonstrate advanced resource management and algorithmic ingenuity. By diversifying the problem set to include such challenges, the benchmark could offer a more realistic and nuanced evaluation of an AI model's capabilities in practical programming scenarios.



\subsection{Evaluating More AI Models}
The dynamic nature of AI development necessitates the continuous inclusion of new models to ensure the benchmark remains relevant. While the current version evaluates prominent models like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini, future iterations should explore additional emerging models. These might include Meta’s LLAMA, specialized models optimized for specific tasks, and other state-of-the-art frameworks developed by research institutions and industry leaders.

By broadening the pool of AI systems under evaluation, the benchmark would provide richer insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different models. This expansion would help in identifying trends across diverse architectures and uncovering areas where further development is needed. Evaluating a variety of models also ensures the benchmark remains a comprehensive tool for analyzing advancements in AI-driven programming.

\subsection{Improving Metrics metrics and Evaluation}

Refining the evaluation metrics is another essential step in advancing the benchmark’s effectiveness. Automating Big O analysis, for instance, could add a deeper layer of assessment by measuring the computational efficiency and scalability of AI-generated solutions. This metric would provide critical insights into the suitability of solutions for real-world applications that involve large datasets or time-sensitive processes.

Stress testing is another promising area for improvement. By running solutions under extreme conditions, such as edge cases or unusually large inputs, the benchmark could evaluate their robustness and resilience. This form of testing would be particularly valuable for assessing how well solutions handle unexpected scenarios, which is often a key requirement in production environments.

Moreover, extending the benchmark to support multiple programming languages would significantly enhance its scope. Evaluating AI models across different languages and coding paradigms would offer a more holistic view of their adaptability and versatility. As modern software engineering often requires proficiency in diverse languages and frameworks, this enhancement would align the benchmark more closely with real-world programming demands.


\subsection{AI Agents for Software Development}


The emergence of AI agents presents an exciting frontier for the benchmark. Unlike traditional models that generate static solutions, AI agents can dynamically interact with external tools, APIs, and environments to solve problems. For example, an AI agent could conduct web searches to gather additional context, leverage APIs to fetch real-time data, or utilize integrated development environments (IDEs) to execute and debug code interactively.

Testing such agents would require a significant rethinking of the benchmark’s structure. New metrics would need to be developed to evaluate their performance effectively, such as the efficiency of multi-step interactions, the accuracy of context-based problem-solving, and the ability to adapt to dynamic requirements. By exploring these advanced capabilities, the benchmark could help illuminate how AI might transition from static problem-solving to dynamic, context-aware programming assistance, further advancing its role in modern software engineering.

The problems used in this study were carefully curated to cover a wide range of scenarios that reflect both theoretical concepts and practical applications in software engineering.

% Problem complexity significantly affects AI performance. Simpler problems, often categorized as "easy," typically involve straightforward logic or basic algorithmic steps, such as iterating through an array or performing simple mathematical calculations. These problems serve as a baseline to assess the AI's ability to produce syntactically and logically correct solutions. AI models generally perform well on these tasks, as they require minimal contextual understanding and rely on commonly observed programming patterns.

% In contrast, more complex problems introduce layers of difficulty that challenge the AI's ability to reason, interpret, and optimize. Medium-difficulty problems often require intermediate skills such as recursion, efficient use of data structures like trees or heaps, or solving problems with moderate constraints. Hard problems push these boundaries further by demanding advanced algorithmic solutions, deep contextual understanding, and the ability to manage multiple interdependent variables. These challenges expose limitations in AI models, such as struggles with abstraction, lack of creativity in designing novel solutions, and inefficiency when faced with computationally intensive tasks.

By refining their ability to interpret complex requirements, AI systems could become indispensable for tackling tasks that demand both technical knowledge and contextual reasoning.

% In addition to independent problem-solving, AI has the potential to become a more effective collaborator in team-based programming environments. By integrating seamlessly into workflows, these models could assist developers in real time, suggesting optimizations, identifying errors, and improving overall code quality. Such advancements would position AI as a trusted partner in the development process, augmenting rather than replacing human expertise.

% Another promising direction lies in enabling AI to handle large-scale, real-world projects. While current models are adept at solving isolated problems, future systems could extend their functionality to manage multi-file software projects with complex dependencies. This would open doors to applications in fields such as enterprise software development, where AI could assist in creating, maintaining, and scaling systems efficiently.

% The expansion of benchmarks and evaluation frameworks will also play a critical role in shaping the trajectory of AI in programming.
