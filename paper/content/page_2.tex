\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{Quantitative Results}

Performance metrics (e.g., success rates on easy, medium, and hard problems).

Comparison of models based on metrics such as speed, efficiency, and accuracy.

Visual representation of results (tables and graphs showing success rates by difficulty).

\subsection{Qualitative Assessment}

Analysis of how the models approach problem-solving (e.g., whether they use brute force, optimal solutions, or heuristics).

Examples of well-solved problems and those where AI models failed.

Discussion of common errors (e.g., logical issues, misunderstanding problem statements, or incomplete outputs).

\subsection{Comparison to Human Performance}

How AI models perform in comparison to average Leetcode users (use most common solution).

Cases where AI outperformed humans (e.g., faster execution of simple problems).

Scenarios where humans excelled.
\subsection{Statistical Analysis}

Maybe some scientific methods to analyze the data.
